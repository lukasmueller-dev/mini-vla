 * its cleanly-reachable side of the floor. Colors are drawn from the first
 * numColors palette entries without replacement, so every block is a distinct
 * color and the named target is unambiguous — but vision has to pick it out
 * among up to four.
 *
 * Two blocks sharing one ~0.20-wide band would occlude each other (a block is
 * up to 0.16 wide, boosted ×silBlockScale in the model's-eye view). placeSide
 * reject-samples same-side positions/sizes until their silhouettes clear by
 * minBlockGap; if no attempt fits within the attempt budget (both drawn large),
 * it falls back to a SINGLE block rather than force an occluding overlap — so
 * two-per-side naturally biases toward smaller blocks, and huge pairs simply
 * don't happen. The unfilled color slot is just left unused (colors stay
 * unique among the blocks actually placed).
 *
 * Reachable-floor analysis (arm base (0.5,0.2), links 0.32+0.26, grasp at
 * y=0.06): the annulus outer radius 0.58 covers the whole floor out to
 * |x-0.5| ≈ 0.56, and the inner radius 0.06 never bites (the base sits 0.14
 * above the floor). BUT blocks within |x-0.5| < 0.167 of the base need an
 * elbow bend past the sampled THETA2_RANGE — a near-singular fold that also
 * renders the forearm through the upper arm — so the genuinely grasp-able
 * floor is the two side BANDS below, not one span through the centre. Each
 * band's edges stay comfortably inside the joint ranges (verified: |θ2| ≤ 2.39
 * at the inner edges) and fully in-frame.
 *
 * Wide placement stays usable at the model input's 48px (lowered 64→48 in the
 * 2026-07 sweep, see IMG_SIZE): a block renders ~6px and a band spans ~9px, and
 * the position signal for the ~0.9-rad elbow swing across a band now rides the
 * sin/cos action coords + the spatial soft-argmax readout rather than raw pixel
 * sharpness, so grasp precision held when imgSize dropped (5-seed grasp rose).
 * At 32px the position was unresolvable (~3px block), the policy learned the
 * per-band MEAN and landed off-centre — which is exactly why placement used to
 * be pinned to ±0.02; the readout + resolution together are what let the
 * scatter widen back out.
 *
 * Each block also randomizes its SIDE LENGTH in [BLOCK_MIN, BLOCK_MAX]. Size
 * is not just cosmetic: the grasp target is the block CENTRE (y = size/2), so a
 * bigger block is grasped higher and the policy has to read the size out of the
 * 48px image to get the reach height right. It also shifts the near-singular
 * dead zone — the LARGEST block (grasped at y=0.08) needs |x−0.5| ≳ 0.181 to
 * keep the elbow inside THETA2_RANGE — so the band inner edges (0.31/0.69) are
 * set for that worst case; smaller blocks clear it with room to spare.
