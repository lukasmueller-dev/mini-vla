// The policy-rollout state machine — the closed-loop episode that drives the
// Rollout box. Extracted from Hero.tsx so the exact same engine can run the
// mini-vla demo/eval renderers. Hero keeps ONLY the rAF loop, canvas painting,
// overlays, panels and readouts; everything about HOW an episode unfolds
// (phases, the learned-grasp gate, carry attachment, stepping toward the last
// async-predicted target while replies are in flight) lives here.
//
// The engine owns the episode's mutable state (phase, arm pose, last predicted
// target + gaze + gripper, trail, and the prediction throttle/in-flight guard)
// and exposes a plain serializable RolloutFrame per step. It is renderer-
// agnostic: the trail is kept in workspace effector coordinates (fk output),
// and the host maps it to canvas pixels (sceneMap) at paint time.
