// Scripted demonstration trajectories for the Demonstration box. A fresh
// plan is generated for every cycle: a new random layout, a random command,
// and noisy waypoints so no two demonstrations are identical. Each plan has
// the same shape as a successful pick-up rollout episode:
//   descend to the commanded block's CENTER, grasp, lift STRAIGHT UP to the
//   rest pose, hold aloft, release (the block resets to the floor for the
//   next cycle — never carried back down)
//
// The rollout box runs in LOCKSTEP with this cycle (same layout + command,
// reset at every cycle boundary; see Hero.tsx), and it runs a FROZEN snapshot
// of the policy taken at that boundary — a fixed policy for the whole attempt
// (how a real rollout works) rather than the live model drifting mid-reach as
// background training updates it. So each of the cycles before convergence
// is a clean side-by-side readout of ONE policy generation vs. the expert.
// The demo MOTION is defined in ABSOLUTE time (the *_MS phase constants
// below), NOT as fractions of the period, so the crisp scripted reach keeps
// the same speed regardless of the period; the period only sets how much
// resting tail follows the release before the next cycle begins.
